### BREAKING CHANGE

- With Terraform 0.12 ability to generate
output from file has been deprecated in favor of from folder
which contains one or more `.tf` files.

- In the JSON format response, list of "Inputs"
has been renamed to `inputs`.
- In the JSON format response, list of "Outputs" has been renamed
to `outputs`.

- In the JSON format respone, module "Comment" has been renamed to module `header`.

- For simplicity we've decided to
deprecated the old `--sort-inputs-by-required` flag
to the simpler and more generic `--sort--by-required`.
The deprecated flags will get removed second release
from now.

- As of Terraform 0.12, the default value of
input variables are shown in full JSON format (if available)
and `--with-aggregate-type-defaults` is not needed anymore.
The flag is marked as soft deprecated and will get removed in
the second release from now.

- With Terraform 0.12 the information about `providers` being used in the module will be generated by default. This will cause the first generation of documents with the latest release of `terraform-docs` binary be slightly different than before, now there will be `Providers` section in Markdown and `providers` block in JSON. You can ignore this by using new `--no-providers` flag if you choose to.
