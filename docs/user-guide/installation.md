`terraform-docs` is available on Linux, macOS, Windows, and FreeBSD platforms.

## Homebrew

If you are a macOS user, you can use [Homebrew].

```bash
brew install terraform-docs
```

## Windows

If you are a Windows user:

### Scoop

You can use [Scoop].

```bash
scoop bucket add terraform-docs https://github.com/terraform-docs/scoop-bucket
scoop install terraform-docs
```

### Chocolatey

or you can use [Chocolatey].

```bash
choco install terraform-docs
```

## Docker

You also can run `terraform-docs` as a container:

```bash
docker run quay.io/terraform-docs/terraform-docs:0.13.0
```

Docker tag `latest` refers to _latest_ stable released version and `edge`refers
to HEAD of `master` at any given point in time. And any named version tags are
identical to the official GitHub releases without leading `v`.

### Wrapper script

You can use a wrapper script placed in your environment PATH to automatically pull the docker image and act as if the command is locally installed.
The upside to this method is that you will always stay on the latest stable version unless you pin the image tag.
The downside to this is that you can not run terraform docs on any path that is not the current working directory or a subfolder of the current working directory, and any folder path provided must be a relative path (not start with /), otherwise it will act as normal.

It might be wise to clean out old docker images after a while if you are running low on space. A simple way to clean out docker is `docker system prune -a`

Create a script in your PATH (eg: /usr/bin) and paste the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
docker pull --quiet quay.io/git-chglog/git-chglog:latest >&2
docker run --rm --workdir="/workdir" -v "$PWD":/workdir quay.io/terraform-docs/terraform-docs $@
```

## Pre-compiled Binary

Stable binaries are available on the GitHub [Release] page. To install, download
the file for your platform from "Assets" and place it into your `$PATH`:

```bash
curl -sSLo ./terraform-docs.tar.gz https://terraform-docs.io/dl/v0.13.0/terraform-docs-v0.13.0-$(uname)-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf terraform-docs.tar.gz
chmod +x terraform-docs
mv terraform-docs /some-dir-in-your-PATH/terraform-docs
```

**Note:** Windows releases are in `ZIP` format.

## Go Users

The latest version can be installed using `go get`:

```bash
GO111MODULE="on" go get github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs@v0.13.0
```

**NOTE:** to download any version **before** `v0.9.1` (inclusive) you need to use to
old module namespace (`segmentio`):

```bash
# only for v0.9.1 and before
GO111MODULE="on" go get github.com/segmentio/terraform-docs@v0.9.1
```

**NOTE:** please use the latest Go to do this, minimum `go1.16` or greater.

This will put `terraform-docs` in `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`. If you encounter the error
`terraform-docs: command not found` after installation then you may need to either add
that directory to your `$PATH` as shown [here] or do a manual installation by cloning
the repo and run `make build` from the repository which will put `terraform-docs` in:

```bash
$(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs/bin/$(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')-amd64/terraform-docs
```

## Code Completion

The code completion for `bash` or `zsh` can be installed as follow. Note that shell
auto-completion is not available on Windows platform.

### bash

```bash
terraform-docs completion bash > ~/.terraform-docs-completion
source ~/.terraform-docs-completion

# or the one-liner below

source <(terraform-docs completion bash)
```

### zsh

```bash
terraform-docs completion zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_terraform-docs
autoload -U compinit && compinit
```

To make this change permanent, the above commands can be added to `~/.profile` file.
